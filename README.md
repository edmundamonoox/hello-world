Hi My name is Edmund Mulcahy Amonoo
Hi! I’m a Computer Science student, where I focus on backend development and distributed systems.

I’ve always been a bit of a problem-solver, whether it's debugging a tricky segmentation fault in C++ or optimizing database queries. I'm really excited to transition into a full-time role where I can contribute to building scalable software and keep learning from a senior engineering team.
